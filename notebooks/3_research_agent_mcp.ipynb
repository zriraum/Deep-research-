      "  - read_file: Read the complete contents of a file from the file system. Handles various text encodings and provides detailed error messages if the file cannot be read. Use this tool when you need to examine the contents of a single file. Use the 'head' parameter to read only the first N lines of a file, or the 'tail' parameter to read only the last N lines of a file. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - read_multiple_files: Read the contents of multiple files simultaneously. This is more efficient than reading files one by one when you need to analyze or compare multiple files. Each file's content is returned with its path as a reference. Failed reads for individual files won't stop the entire operation. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - write_file: Create a new file or completely overwrite an existing file with new content. Use with caution as it will overwrite existing files without warning. Handles text content with proper encoding. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - edit_file: Make line-based edits to a text file. Each edit replaces exact line sequences with new content. Returns a git-style diff showing the changes made. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - create_directory: Create a new directory or ensure a directory exists. Can create multiple nested directories in one operation. If the directory already exists, this operation will succeed silently. Perfect for setting up directory structures for projects or ensuring required paths exist. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - list_directory: Get a detailed listing of all files and directories in a specified path. Results clearly distinguish between files and directories with [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes. This tool is essential for understanding directory structure and finding specific files within a directory. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - list_directory_with_sizes: Get a detailed listing of all files and directories in a specified path, including sizes. Results clearly distinguish between files and directories with [FILE] and [DIR] prefixes. This tool is useful for understanding directory structure and finding specific files within a directory. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - directory_tree: Get a recursive tree view of files and directories as a JSON structure. Each entry includes 'name', 'type' (file/directory), and 'children' for directories. Files have no children array, while directories always have a children array (which may be empty). The output is formatted with 2-space indentation for readability. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - move_file: Move or rename files and directories. Can move files between directories and rename them in a single operation. If the destination exists, the operation will fail. Works across different directories and can be used for simple renaming within the same directory. Both source and destination must be within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - search_files: Recursively search for files and directories matching a pattern. Searches through all subdirectories from the starting path. The search is case-insensitive and matches partial names. Returns full paths to all matching items. Great for finding files when you don't know their exact location. Only searches within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - get_file_info: Retrieve detailed metadata about a file or directory. Returns comprehensive information including size, creation time, last modified time, permissions, and type. This tool is perfect for understanding file characteristics without reading the actual content. Only works within allowed directories.\n",
      "  - list_allowed_directories: Returns the list of directories that this server is allowed to access. Use this to understand which directories are available before trying to access files.\n",

    "### ⚠️ Why Async is Required for MCP Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "When using MCP tools with LangChain, you MUST use async methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to use sync methods, you'll get this error:\n",
    "```\n",
    "╭──────────────────────────────────────────────── 🔧 Tool Output ─────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n",
    "│ Error: NotImplementedError('StructuredTool does not support sync invocation.')                                  │\n",
    "│  Please fix your mistakes.     \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why async is required:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP Protocol Design**: The Model Context Protocol is inherently asynchronous\n",
    "    - Server communication uses async JSON-RPC over stdio/http\n",
    "    - Tool invocations involve network/IPC calls that can be slow\n",
    "    - Async enables non-blocking, concurrent operations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LangChain MCP Adapters**: The adapters are designed for async-only operation\n",
    "    - Tools are wrapped as async StructuredTools\n",
    "    - Sync invocation is intentionally not implemented\n",
    "    - This ensures consistent async behavior across all MCP tools\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance Benefits**: Async enables:\n",
    "    - Concurrent tool execution\n",
    "    - Non-blocking server communication\n",
    "    - Better resource utilization\n",
    "    - Responsive applications\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Technical Architecture**: \n",
    "    - MCP servers run as subprocesses\n",
    "    - Communication happens over pipes (stdin/stdout)\n",
    "    - These I/O operations are naturally async\n",
    "    - Blocking sync calls would freeze the entire process\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use async methods with MCP tools\n",
    "* ✅ Correct: agent.ainvoke() - async\n",
    "* ❌ Incorrect: agent.invoke() - sync (will fail)"

Let's Understand Each Component\n\n#### 1. 📋 The `mcp_config` Dictionary\n```python\nmcp_config = {\n    \"filesystem\": {  # Server name (arbitrary label)\n        \"command\": \"npx\",  # Command to run\n        \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/path/to/docs\"],\n        \"transport\": \"stdio\"  # Communication method\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**What it is**: A configuration dictionary that tells the MCP client how to start and connect to MCP servers.\n\n**Key parts**:\n- **Server name** (`\"filesystem\"`): An arbitrary label for this server instance\n- **Command** (`\"npx\"`): The command to execute to start the server\n- **Args**: Command-line arguments passed to the server\n- **Transport**: How the client communicates with the server (stdio = standard input/output)\n\n#### 2. 🖥️ Is This a Locally Running Process?\n**YES!** Here's what happens:\n\n1. **Server Startup**: When you create `MultiServerMCPClient(mcp_config)`, it:\n   - Executes `npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/docs`\n   - This starts a **subprocess** running the filesystem server\n   - The server runs **locally on your machine**\n\n2. **Communication**: The client and server communicate through:\n   - **STDIN**: Client sends requests to the server\n   - **STDOUT**: Server sends responses back to the client\n   - **Structured JSON**: All communication uses the MCP protocol format\n\n3. **Lifecycle**: The server process runs as long as the client is active\n\n#### 3. 🔧 What is the `client`?\n```python\nclient = MultiServerMCPClient(mcp_config)\n```\n\n**The client is a bridge** that:\n- **Starts MCP servers** based on your configuration\n- **Manages communication** with one or more server processes\n- **Handles the MCP protocol** (JSON-RPC over stdio)\n- **Provides a unified interface** to access tools from multiple servers\n\n**Behind the scenes**:\n```python\n# What MultiServerMCPClient does internally:\n# 1. Parse the config\n# 2. Start subprocess: npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path\n# 3. Establish stdio communication channels\n# 4. Send initialization messages\n# 5. Query available tools\n```\n\n#### 4. 🛠️ Tool Discovery and Description\n```python\ntools = await client.get_tools()\n```\n\n**This step**:\n- **Queries each server**: \"What tools do you provide?\"\n- **Receives tool metadata**: Name, description, parameters, types\n- **Converts to LangChain format**: Makes them compatible with LangChain agents\n\n**Example tool metadata**:\n```python\n{\n    \"name\": \"read_file\",\n    \"description\": \"Read the complete contents of a file\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"path\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"Path to the file to read\"}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### 5. 🤖 Agent Integration - It Just Works!\n```python\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"openai:gpt-4.1\")\nagent = create_react_agent(model, tools)\n```\n\n**The magic happens here**:\n1. **Tool Binding**: The LLM is told about available tools and their descriptions\n2. **Automatic Tool Selection**: The LLM decides which tools to use based on the user's request\n3. **Tool Execution**: When the LLM calls a tool, the agent:\n   - Sends the tool call to the MCP client\n   - The client forwards it to the appropriate server\n   - The server executes the operation (e.g., reads a file)\n   - Results flow back: Server → Client → Agent → LLM\n\n#### 6. 🔄 The Complete Flow\n```\nUser Request → LLM → Tool Decision → MCP Client → MCP Server → File System\n                ↑                                                      ↓\n         Response ← Tool Results ← MCP Client ← MCP Server ← File Contents\n```\n\n## 🧠 Why This is Powerful\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: The LLM focuses on reasoning, MCP servers handle actions\n2. **Extensibility**: Add new capabilities by adding new MCP servers\n3. **Security**: Servers can implement their own access controls\n4. **Standardization**: All tools follow the same MCP protocol\n5. **Local Execution**: No need to send sensitive data to external APIs\n\n## 🔧 Under the Hood: Technical Details\n\nWhen you run the code above:\n\n1. **Server Process**: A Node.js process starts running the filesystem server\n2. **IPC Communication**: Client and server communicate via stdin/stdout pipes\n3. **JSON-RPC Protocol**: All messages follow the MCP specification\n4. **Tool Registration**: Server announces its capabilities to the client\n5. **LangChain Integration**: Tools are wrapped as LangChain-compatible functions\n6. **Execution**: Tool calls are translated to MCP requests and executed\n\nThis creates a **seamless bridge** between your LLM and local system capabilities!\n\n## 🚀 Deep Dive: Async Programming in Python & LangGraph\n\n### What is Async Programming?\n\n**Async programming** allows your code to handle multiple operations concurrently without blocking. Instead of waiting for one operation to complete before starting another, async enables cooperative multitasking where operations can yield control and resume later.\n\n### 🔄 Python asyncio Fundamentals\n\n**Key Concepts from [Python asyncio docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html):**\n\n1. **Coroutines**: Functions defined with `async def` that can be paused and resumed\n2. **Event Loop**: Central mechanism managing asynchronous operations\n3. **Tasks**: Units of concurrent execution\n4. **Awaitable Objects**: Objects that can be used with `await`\n\n**Basic Example:**\n```python\nasync def fetch_data():\n    print('Fetching data...')\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate I/O operation\n    print('Data fetched!')\n    return \"data\"\n\n# Run coroutine\nresult = await fetch_data()\n```\n\n### 🏗️ LangGraph Async Architecture\n\n**From [LangGraph async docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/graph-api/#async):**\n\n**Key Async Methods:**\n- `.ainvoke()`: Asynchronous graph invocation\n- `.astream()`: Asynchronous streaming execution\n- `async def` node functions for concurrent operations\n\n**Why LangGraph Uses Async:**\n1. **Concurrent API Calls**: Multiple LLM requests can run simultaneously\n2. **Non-blocking I/O**: Tool calls don't block other operations\n3. **Better Resource Utilization**: More efficient handling of I/O-bound tasks\n4. **Scalability**: Handle multiple conversations concurrently\n\n### 🔍 Async vs Sync Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Synchronous | Asynchronous |\n|--------|-------------|--------------|\n| **Execution** | Sequential, blocking | Concurrent, non-blocking |\n| **I/O Handling** | Waits for each operation | Yields control during waits |\n| **Performance** | Limited by slowest operation | Parallelizes I/O operations |\n| **Complexity** | Simpler to understand | Requires async/await syntax |\n| **Use Cases** | CPU-bound tasks | I/O-bound operations |\n\n### 🎯 Why MCP Requires Async\n\n**Technical Reasons:**\n1. **IPC Communication**: MCP servers communicate via stdin/stdout pipes\n2. **JSON-RPC Protocol**: Network-style communication inherently async\n3. **Tool Execution**: File operations and subprocess calls are I/O-bound\n4. **Concurrency**: Multiple tool calls can execute simultaneously\n\n**Performance Benefits:**\n```python\n# Synchronous (blocking)\nresult1 = read_file(\"file1.txt\")  # Wait 100ms\nresult2 = read_file(\"file2.txt\")  # Wait 100ms\n# Total time: 200ms\n\n# Asynchronous (non-blocking)\nresult1, result2 = await asyncio.gather(\n    read_file(\"file1.txt\"),  # 100ms\n    read_file(\"file2.txt\")   # 100ms (concurrent)\n)\n# Total time: 100ms\n```\n\n### 🛠️ Async in Our MCP Agent\n\n**Our Implementation:**\n```python\nasync def llm_call(state: MessagesState):\n    \"\"\"Async LLM call - non-blocking\"\"\"\n    return {\n        \"messages\": [\n            await model_with_tools.ainvoke(  # Non-blocking LLM call\n                [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt}] + state[\"messages\"]\n            )\n        ]\n    }\n\nasync def tool_node(state: dict):\n    \"\"\"Async tool execution - allows concurrent tool calls\"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for tool_call in state[\"messages\"][-1].tool_calls:\n        tool = tools_by_name[tool_call[\"name\"]]\n        observation = await tool.ainvoke(tool_call[\"args\"])  # Non-blocking MCP call\n        result.append(ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call[\"id\"]))\n    return {\"messages\": result}\n```\n\n### 🏃‍♂️ Performance Impact\n\n**Why Async Matters for MCP:**\n1. **File I/O**: Reading files is I/O-bound - async prevents blocking\n2. **Subprocess Communication**: MCP server communication is async by nature\n3. **Multiple Tools**: Can execute multiple file operations concurrently\n4. **Responsiveness**: Agent remains responsive during long operations\n\n**Example Performance Difference:**\n```python\n# Sync approach (would fail with MCP)\nfiles = [\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\", \"file3.txt\"]\nfor file in files:\n    content = read_file(file)  # Each takes 50ms\n    # Total: 150ms sequential\n\n# Async approach (what MCP uses)\nfiles = [\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\", \"file3.txt\"]\ncontents = await asyncio.gather(*[\n    read_file(file) for file in files  # All run concurrently\n])\n# Total: 50ms concurrent\n```\n\n### 🎲 Best Practices for Async in Jupyter\n\n**Jupyter Considerations:**\n1. **Event Loop**: Jupyter runs its own event loop\n2. **Top-level await**: Notebooks support await at the top level\n3. **Tool Compatibility**: MCP tools are async-only by design\n\n**Common Patterns:**\n```python\n# ✅ Correct: Async tool usage\ntools = await client.get_tools()\nresult = await agent.ainvoke(messages)\n\n# ❌ Incorrect: Sync won't work with MCP\n# tools = client.get_tools()  # This would fail\n# result = agent.invoke(messages)  # This would fail\n```\n\n### 💡 Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Async is Essential**: MCP protocol requires async - no sync alternative\n2. **Performance Gains**: Significant speedup for I/O-bound operations\n3. **Concurrency**: Multiple operations can run simultaneously\n4. **Non-blocking**: Operations don't freeze the entire application\n5. **Modern Python**: Async/await is the standard for I/O-bound applications\n\nThe async nature of MCP isn't just a technical detail - it's a fundamental design choice that enables **fast, responsive, and scalable** AI agent interactions!",
