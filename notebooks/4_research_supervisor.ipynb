    "## The Case for Multi-Agent Research Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously built a research agent bound to either custom tools or MCP server.Now, what happens if the request is complex and has several sub-topics? Single agent response quality suffers wuth multiple sub-topics (e.g., compare A to B to C) because a single context window needs to store and reason about tool feedback across all of the sub-topics. This tool feedback is often token heavy. [Numerous failure modes](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html), such as [context clash](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html), become prevalent as the context window accumulates tool calls across many different sub-topics. As detailed in [Anthropic's engineering blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system), multi-agent systems offer significant advantages over single-agent approaches for complex research tasks.\n",
