# 🧱 Deep Research From Scratch 

Deep research has broken out as one of the most popular agent applications. [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/), [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/introducing-perplexity-deep-research), and [Google](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/?hl=en) all have deep research products that produce comprehensive reports using [various sources](https://www.anthropic.com/news/research) of context. There are also many [open](https://huggingface.co/blog/open-deep-research) [source](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-fullstack-langgraph-quickstart) implementations. We built an [open deep researcher](https://github.com/langchain-ai/open_deep_research) that is simple and configurable, allowing users to bring their own models, search tools, and MCP servers. In this repo, we'll build a deep researcher from scratch! Here is a map of the major pieces that we will build:

## 🚀 Quickstart 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep_research_from_scratch
cd deep_research_from_scratch
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the package and dependencies:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Background 

Research is an open‑ended task; the best strategy to answer a user request can’t be easily known in advance. Requests can require different research strategies and varying levels of search depth. Consider this request. 

[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#agent) are well suited to research because they can flexibly apply different strategies, using intermediate results to guide their exploration. Open deep research uses an agent to conduct research as part of a three step process:

1. **Scope** – clarify research scope
2. **Research** – perform research
3. **Write** – produce the final report

## 📝 Organization 

This repo contains 5 tutorial notebooks that build a deep research system from scratch:

### 📚 Tutorial Notebooks

#### 1. User Clarification and Brief Generation (`notebooks/1_scoping.ipynb`)
**Purpose**: Clarify research scope and transform user input into structured research briefs

**Key Concepts**:
- **User Clarification**: Determines if additional context is needed from the user using structured output
- **Brief Generation**: Transforms conversations into detailed research questions
- **LangGraph Commands**: Using Command system for flow control and state updates
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic schemas for reliable decision making

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Two-step workflow: clarification → brief generation
- Structured output models (`ClarifyWithUser`, `ResearchQuestion`) to prevent hallucination
- Conditional routing based on clarification needs
- Date-aware prompts for context-sensitive research

**What You'll Learn**: State management, structured output patterns, conditional routing

#### 2. Research Agent with Custom Tools (`notebooks/2_research_agent.ipynb`)
**Purpose**: Build an iterative research agent using external search tools

**Key Concepts**:
- **Agent Architecture**: LLM decision node + tool execution node pattern
- **Async Operations**: Concurrent tool execution for better performance
- **Search Integration**: Tavily search with content summarization
- **Tool Execution**: ReAct-style agent loop with tool calling

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Async tool execution using `asyncio.gather()` for parallel searches
- Content summarization to compress search results
- Iterative research loop with conditional routing
- Rich prompt engineering for comprehensive research

**What You'll Learn**: Agent patterns, async programming, tool integration, search optimization

#### 3. Research Agent with MCP (`notebooks/3_research_agent_mcp.ipynb`)
**Purpose**: Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers as research tools

**Key Concepts**:
- **Model Context Protocol**: Standardized protocol for AI tool access
- **MCP Architecture**: Client-server communication via stdio/HTTP
- **LangChain MCP Adapters**: Seamless integration of MCP servers as LangChain tools
- **Local vs Remote MCP**: Understanding transport mechanisms

**Implementation Highlights**:
- `MultiServerMCPClient` for managing MCP servers
- Configuration-driven server setup (filesystem example)
- Rich formatting for tool output display
- Async-only tool execution due to MCP protocol requirements

**What You'll Learn**: MCP integration, client-server architecture, protocol-based tool access

---

#### 4. Research Supervisor (`notebooks/4_research_supervisor.ipynb`)
**Purpose**: Multi-agent coordination for complex research tasks

**Key Concepts**:
- **Supervisor Pattern**: Coordination agent + worker agents
- **Parallel Research**: Concurrent research agents for independent topics
- **Research Delegation**: Structured tools for task assignment
- **Context Isolation**: Separate context windows for different research topics

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Two-node supervisor pattern (`supervisor` + `supervisor_tools`)
- Parallel research execution using `asyncio.gather()`
- Structured tools (`ConductResearch`, `ResearchComplete`) for delegation
- Configurable concurrency limits and iteration controls

**What You'll Learn**: Multi-agent patterns, parallel processing, research coordination

---

#### 5. Full Multi-Agent Research System (`notebooks/5_full_agent.ipynb`)
**Purpose**: Complete end-to-end research system integrating all components

**Key Concepts**:
- **Three-Phase Architecture**: Scope → Research → Write
- **System Integration**: Combining scoping, multi-agent research, and report generation
- **State Management**: Complex state flow across subgraphs
- **End-to-End Workflow**: From user input to final research report

**Implementation Highlights**:
- Complete workflow integration with proper state transitions
- Supervisor and researcher subgraphs with output schemas
- Final report generation with research synthesis
- Thread-based conversation management for clarification

**What You'll Learn**: System architecture, subgraph composition, end-to-end workflows

### 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

- **Structured Output**: Using Pydantic schemas for reliable AI decision making
- **Async Programming**: Concurrent operations for better performance
- **Agent Patterns**: ReAct loops, supervisor patterns, multi-agent coordination
