"""Multi-agent supervisor for coordinating research across multiple specialized agents.

This module implements a supervisor pattern where:
1. A supervisor agent coordinates research activities and delegates tasks
2. Multiple researcher agents work on specific sub-topics independently
3. Results are aggregated and compressed for final reporting

The supervisor uses parallel research execution to improve efficiency while
maintaining isolated context windows for each research topic.
